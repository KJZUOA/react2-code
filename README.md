# REACT2 Project
This code is for the REACT2 project and related paper "Machine Learning to Support Visual Auditing of Home-based Lateral Flow Immunoassay Self-Test Results for SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies" [Communications Medicine 2022].

## Overview
The project can be divied into two major parts: [segmentation](./segmentation) and [classification](./classification). The code and details are provided in each sub-folder. The pretrained models of both **segmentation** and **classification** tasks can be downloaded from the [releases page](https://github.com/TianhongDai/react2-code/releases).  

**Please Note**: Porting of the ALFA pipeline described in the paper to this Git repository is in progress. It will take time as ALFA was developed for a specific batch processing system on a specific university cluster.

If you have further questions, please contact me.
